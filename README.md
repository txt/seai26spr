<h1 align="center">:cyclone: CSC491/591 (013): Software Engineering and AI <br>NC State, Spring '26</h1>

> **Welcome to the laboratory. Let's find out what actually
works.**



AI presents unique challenges and opportunities when applied to
software engineering. Unlike other domains, SE involves evolving
requirements, human-in-the-loop decisions, and complex socio-technical
ecosystems, making the integration of AI both powerful and precarious.
This course will explore AI methods for SE, such as explainable AI,
classification and clustering, multi-objective optimization,
semi-supervised learning (useful when labeled data is scarce),
theorem proving and logical reasoning, and generative methods enable
code suggestion, test generation, and documentation support.

- 491/591 students:
  - Students will apply sound research methods/tools to problems
  in “AI to SE” and “SE to AI” and describe the methods/tools
  effectively - Students will analyze/interpret research data -
  Students will communicate their research clearly and professionally
  in both written and oral forms appropriate to “AI to SE” and “SE
  to AI”
- 591 students:
  - State a research problem in such a way that it clearly fits
  within the context of the literature in “AI to SE” and “SE to AI”
  - Demonstrate the value of a research solution to the research
  problem in advancing knowledge within that area

## This subject, in a nutshell:

- Much more intricate than csc510
- LLMs, sure but...
- Maybe everything should or could be  solved by "throwing an LLM at it"
[[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk)]; [[2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mR4jzEWzN5IQdtfSIovU2-YbEcvCZoaPAp5vDBFejqI/edit?slide=id.g3824839c8bf_4_29#slide=id.g3824839c8bf_4_29)]; [[3](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fjxnlqgt8l4uf1.jpeg)].
- SE coding (low level) has far less impact that SE planning (high level)
- So how to make decisions about SE projects? Decades before LLMs there was simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, etc etc.
- And how  how to explain those decisions? What does "explanation mean"?
- Ugrds: teams of three: 6 homeworks 
- Grads: teams of two: 4  homeworks and a two part assignment (team)
- Homeworks: submit something one week, review someone else's next week.
- No exams (weekly in-class quiz).
- Classes are in person. To ensure that, all submissions are in-person, by the whole group.
  Anyone missing gets a cross. First three crosses cost nothing. After that, each cross is -1 mark.
